Every team member will contribute to develop the web page of the Travel Agency so everybody will have shared responsibilities for every part of the project/code. The team leader will assist and check the work everyone is doing periodically and make sure the parts are compatible and work well together.

Following an extensive need analysis, our team has identified a critical issue within our travel agency: the lack of an efficient booking management system. This inefficiency results in delayed and inaccurate itinerary updates for our customers, impacting both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

The team proposes implementing a new booking management system to address the identified problem of inefficient booking processes. The client will be able to get information about the flight, reserve and manage his bookings in real time in an easier and more user-friendly way.


The scope of the project includes developing an integrated booking management system with the following key feature:
1.	Centralized booking platform for seamless booking of travel services.
Limitations include:
1.	Limited customization options for customer preferences.

The overall aim of the project is to enhance the efficiency and customer satisfaction of the travel agency's booking process through the implementation of an efficient booking management system.
We intend to develop a user-friendly web-based application that includes many destinations for the user to chose from and some details about each destination. After booking the user will be able to see which of the destinations he has booked and make changes such as the date or even cancel the trip and then book another destination. The admin will be able to add, remove or edit destinations after logging in.
