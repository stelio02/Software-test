# Project Details

## Project Title: Travel Agency Webpage

## Problem Statement:
Following an extensive need analysis, our team has identified a critical issue within our travel agency: the lack of an efficient booking management system. This inefficiency results in delayed and inaccurate itinerary updates for our customers, impacting both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Solution Proposed:
The team proposes implementing a new booking management system to address the identified problem of inefficient booking processes. The client will be able to get information about the flight, reserve and manage his bookings in real time in an easier and more user-friendly way.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** The scope of the project includes developing an integrated booking management system .
- **Main Objectives:**
1. Develop a centralized booking platform for seamless booking of travel services.
2. Develop a user-friendly and easy to use website.
3. ...

## Application Description:
We intend to develop a user-friendly web-based application that includes many destinations for the user to chose from and some details about each destination. After booking the user will be able to see which of the destinations he has booked and make changes such as the date or even cancel the trip and then book another destination. The admin will be able to add, remove or edit destinations after logging in.
